SpreeGoogleTrustedStore
=======================

Introduction goes here.

Installation
------------

Add spree_google_trusted_store to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_google_trusted_store'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_google_trusted_store:install
```

Using
-----

Call google_trusted_store_badge at the bottom of your store layout, and google_trusted_store_order_confirmation
at the bottom of your order confirmation page.

Additionally, checkout the generated google_product.rb initializer after installing.

Google Shopping
---------------

To use Google Shopping, make an initializer with GoogleProduct.Attributes.configure do |config| ...

(TODO be more specific)

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_google_trusted_store/factories'
```
